* Frontend:

* Backend:

FEATURE IDEAS:

- improve and add ways to easily customize how recipe content is displayed:
  - for ingredients: alternate between normal and slightly off background color for every ingredient to improve readability
  - markdown-like way to create ordered and unordered lists, headings, links, etc.
- better season calendar system without using tags
- ability to add/edit tags
- search by ingredients
- generate grocery list based on saved recipes, taking into account ingredients the user has at home 
- sort by last cooked (potentially most/least cooked?)
  - requires way to track when user cooks recipe (just a button on recipe page?)

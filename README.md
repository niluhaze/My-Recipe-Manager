How to set up this project and run it in a development environment such as VSCode:
Assuming you have already downloaded the project files and have node.js installed:
1) Setup a MongoDB instance, e.g. using MongoDB Compass (I named it "recipe-manager" with a collection "recipes")
2) To import the project into VSCode: Open VSCode and import under "File > Open Workspace from File..."
3) Open a console in the folder "backend" and run "npm install" to install the backend packages
) 
) Run "npm run devStart" to start the backend server
) Open a second console in the folder "frontend" and again run "npm install"
) Run "npm run dev" to start the frontend dev server
